# HelixSnake
Project:  Helix Snake

The goal of the project is to develop a snake game version which can generate amino acidsâ€™ codons.
 
# General Information #

The game is played controlling a moving snake in 25*60 area. There are four letters which are A (Adenine), C (Cytosine), G (Guanine) and T (Thymine) in the game area. The snake starts with 3 letters assigned randomly out of four letter (A, C, G, T). When the snake eats these letters, it becomes longer. If the snake bumps into a wall or its own body the game is over.

# Amino Acids #
There are twenty amino acids found in proteins. Amino acids are represented with codons. Each codon contains 3 letter of the DNA coding units T, C, A and G. All 64 possible 3-letter combinations of T, C, A and G are used either to encode one of these amino acids or as one of the three stop codons that signals the end of a sequence. 

# Requirements  <br>
--> Add enigma.jar to your external library.<br>
--> Add amioacids.txt and highscoretable.txt to your project folder.<br>

Take look project presentation in repository folder for more information.<br>
